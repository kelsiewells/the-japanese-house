  	"Curiosity alone doesn’t have much of a shelf life, but with Clean, The Japanese House’s second EP of the year, Bain prompts more questions about herself and her work than she answers. The four-song release swirls in a fog of vocoders, synthesizers, samplers, and guitars, while Bain’s lyrics — simple, often repeated — draw you into the blurry edges of her persona. Her gaze rests on landscapes — clear, blue water, clean, bright light — that transform into people, and back again. On the polyrhythmic title track, Bain sings of being purified in the light of someone else’s gaze. Affection becomes an environmental phenomenon, something powerful and prone to mutation. “I knew it wouldn’t last/ But in the clean light you cast/ I was good,” she sings, her voice split, pitch-shifted, and layered, and somehow, at the end of it, whole."
